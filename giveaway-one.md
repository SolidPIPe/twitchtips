Hey gamers, casters and viewers! Today we have a special treat for you all - thanks to the awesome guys and girls at Twitch we've been given [**5 Kappa Emote subscriptions**](http://twitch.tv/twitch/subscribe) to giveaway!  
<br>
These subscriptions last until December 31st, 11:59AM - essentially it's a subscription to Twitch's official channel until end of the year so you can use their wonderful coloured Kappa emotes!  
<br>
We've been pondering how to give these away for the last 24 hours and finally decided on giving everyone an equal chance to win.  
<br>
**3 Kappa Emote Packs** can be won by contributing to TwitchTips, send us a helpful tip, guide or article and if it gives us goosebumps or even a smile we'll send you a redeem code for your Kappa pack!  
<br>
**The Last 2 Kappa Emote Packs** can be won by sharing this page via Twitter! All you have to do is go to the top of this page, hit share with Twitter and tweet with the popup text you're given which includes the hashtag #TwitchTips. From those that tweet within the next 24 hours will be entered into the draw!    
<br>
Be sure to follow us on Twitter so we can DM you the redeem code if you do win! If you're not following us, we'll send you a tweet to let you know you won, but if you don't reply within 24 hours we'll unfortunately have to give it away to a runner up.
