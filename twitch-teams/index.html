      <p>Twitch teams. That feeling of being a part of something special with your fellow broadcasters. </p>

<p><br />A sense of belonging sharing a common bond within the vast awesomeness of Twitch. But what purpose do they really serve and how can they help you as a streamer?</p>

<p><br />Let’s get started with the basics first though!</p>

<h2 id="what-is-a-twitch-team">What is a Twitch Team?</h2>
<p>A Twitch team is a grouping of streamers who voluntarily join upon being invited by a team maker. Typically these people have a common goal, mindset, game, or approach to streaming that binds them together under their team banner. </p>

<p><br />It’s a multi-way endorsement that says to Twitch viewers: these streams I approve of and they approve of me, so check them out!</p>

<h2 id="what-does-a-twitch-team-look-like">What does a Twitch Team look like?</h2>
<p>If someone is a part of at least one team, you’ll be able to see this under their stream title. Like so:</p>

<figure>
    <a href="/images/twitch-teams.png"><img src="/images/twitch-teams.png" /></a>
</figure>

<h2 id="who-can-make-a-team">Who can make a team?</h2>
<p>Teams can only be created by a partnered streamer (no sub button required!). </p>

<p><br />The partner emails partnersupport in order to request a team. Once approved, the partner can then go to; </p>

<ul>
  <li>Settings</li>
  <li>Click “Channels &amp; Videos”</li>
  <li>Scroll down to “Teams”</li>
</ul>

<p>Click “Edit” team (or just add your team url name to this: http://www.twitch.tv/team/YOURNAMEHERE/edit) and add members, manage the order in which members will appear, and add art to spiff the main-page up. </p>

<p><br />You can add a featured channel to this main-page, review the archives, as well as review stats and revenue for any team member that has enabled sharing these features.</p>

<h2 id="are-there-any-minimum-or-maximum-for-members-on-a-team">Are there any minimum or maximum for members on a team?</h2>
<p>Nope! You are free to have as exclusive or as populated of a team as you like.</p>

<h2 id="is-there-a-limit-for-how-many-teams-someone-can-join">Is there a limit for how many teams someone can join?</h2>
<p>Nope! Commit to a singular meaningful favorite or collect them like Pokémon.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-you-join-a-team">How do you join a team?</h2>
<p>To join a team follow below instructions;</p>

<ul>
  <li>Go to your Settings</li>
  <li>Click “Channels &amp; Videos”</li>
  <li>Scroll down to “Teams”</li>
  <li>Select “Accept” on an invite.</li>
</ul>

<p>The three options you also have are to share your stats (partner only), your revenue (advertising, partner only), and to set a certain team - if you’re part of more than one - as your featured team under your stream title.</p>

<p><br />The revenue option allows the team owner to see your revenue if you are a Twitch Partner. However, your revenue remains tied to your account only and is not shared with the team owner or the team in any other way.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-you-leave-a-team">How do you leave a team?</h2>
<p>To leave a team follow below instructions;</p>

<ul>
  <li>Go to your Settings</li>
  <li>Click “Channels &amp; Videos”</li>
  <li>Scroll down to “Teams”</li>
  <li>Select “Remove” for the team you wish to leave </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>(Note: read below for the social side of this action)</strong></p>

<hr />

<h2 id="would-you-like-to-know-more">Would you like to know more?</h2>
<p>There are finer points of team dynamics as well. Read on if you need more on the social aspects of being in or running a team.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="what-benefits-can-being-in-a-team-really-provide">What benefits can being in a team really provide?</h2>
<p>Some teams are not active in cross-promotion or pushing a particular brand. These sorts of teams are quite dormant for networking and therefore do not provide much benefit to the team members in terms of channel growth. </p>

<p><br />These sorts of teams might prefer to show an exclusive circle of friends or a collection of streamers under a network that are not tied together on any other aspect. Often though, to be in a team means you are there to promote your fellow team-mates as well as be promoted by them. </p>

<p><br />It’s a mutually beneficial sort of thing. I’d suggest you don’t expect much if you aren’t willing to pitch in. Remember, this micro-community only has as much value as you and your fellow team-mates place in it!</p>

<h2 id="is-it-better-or-worse-to-be-on-more-than-one-team">Is it better or worse to be on more than one team?</h2>
<p>From what I’ve seen, there are some people who stick to only one team and focus only on that. There are others who are in 3+ teams which all share roughly the same viewership; and in this sort of situation, most streamers in each team often play the same games. </p>

<p><br />Therefore, joining too many teams in the same game community is only cannibalizing your own cross-team exposure potential. At the same time, your channel shows up on more team pages and potentially brings more new eyes to your page. The choice is yours.</p>

<h2 id="when-should-i-join-a-team">When should I join a team?</h2>
<p>There is no certain ‘right time’ to join a team. It’s entirely up to when you feel comfortable. If you’re thinking you wish to try for a career as a streamer, then you might want to be more careful and take longer to consider your options than if you merely enjoy streaming as a hobby. </p>

<p><br />Ask yourself a few simple questions before committing: do you know all of the streamers on the team? Do you have any personal discomfort with any current members? Do you enjoy watching most of the members? Are these other channels the sort you’d proudly send your own viewers to? Being on a team means to your viewers that you approve of the channels under the same team name.</p>

<h2 id="is-it-better-to-make-my-own-team-or-join-another">Is it better to make my own team or join another?</h2>
<p>That depends on a few aspects of your channel and how much free time you have. </p>

<p><br />Managing a team doesn’t take THAT much extra work, but does take some, as you need to create and maintain relationships with the members you’ve invited (you should do this even if you’re just a member), help promote their streams and set an example for them (chances are they are all smaller than you if you’re the team creator), and of course, it’s best if you put effort into creating a logo and art for the main-page as well. </p>

<p><br />Art isn’t required, but if you want a professional team image, then you’ll prioritize getting branding done.</p>

<p><br />But maybe you aren’t interested in doing all of that management or maybe you don’t feel it’s for you due to time requirements or whatever other reason. If that’s the case, then simply joining another team might be better for you. </p>

<p><br />Joining another team means you still ought to cross-promote and be considerate to your fellow team-mates, but there is far less work involved and less potential responsibility</p>

<p><br />Or - if neither of these options appeal to you - you can simply ‘lonewolf’ it on Twitch and avoid teams altogether! There are small and big streamers that do not have a team and are not part of someone else’s. The choice is yours. Networking is possible even without joining a team anyhow - so don’t feel obligated for the sake of your channel.</p>

<h2 id="what-do-i-do-if-i-want-to-leave-a-team-whats-the-most-professional-way-to-do-so">What do I do if I want to leave a team? What’s the most professional way to do so?</h2>
<p>Remember that you are your brand on Twitch. Whatever manner you conduct yourself in might have an impact on your channel as a whole and might follow you for some time. </p>

<p><br />Clear and professional communication is best. I’d suggest messaging the team owner and leaving them a short and polite note that you appreciated your experience with the team but you feel it’s time to move on and you wish them the best. Easy peasy.</p>
